## Nodes

### Text

Display a message from the specified actor.
Actor: Specify the actor who will say the speech.
Speech: The text the actor will say.

### Choice

Intended to populate the players choices for responses.
Title: The title of the choice. This is useful for cases when the buttons the player would have to chose from
will differ from the actual speech he will say.
Speech: The text the actor will say.

### Set

Sets a variable to a value. Can link to one Text, Node, Set, or Branch.

### Branch

Takes one of several paths based on the value of a variable. Each port can link to one Text, Node, Set, or Branch.

### Node

Does nothing. Can link to one Text, Node, Set, or Branch, or to one or more Choices.

## Usage

Fire up the HTML, make your dialog and export.
You can add ?load="file.json" to the URL to load a graph saved on cache.

## Not Implemented Yet - `TODO`:

- Add ?import="file.json" to import a graph from disk.
- Add the ability to make a node a starting node.
- Display the Id of the node on each node.
